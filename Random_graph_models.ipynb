    "As expected, the $C_{net}$ coefficient of the original graph is much larger than the average $C_{net}$ coefficient for the 80 runs of the PRG and the realizations of the Configuration Model. It is expected because in this random models, the probability of form triangles is small. In both cases, the value of the average over realizations is close to $\\frac{\\langle z \\rangle}{N-1}$, which agrees with the value we analyzed in the lecture for the clustering coefficient. I think that this N = 62 is large enough to observe this trend. \n",

    "As expected, the diameters of the Configuration Model and the PRG are lower than the actual diameter. And this is repeated in both cases -when the resultant model is either a connected or a non-connected graph. I think N is not big enough, but for bigger N's, we should expect that $ d_{diam} \\:\\alpha \\: ln(N) $, and $ln(N)\\:=\\:ln(62)\\:=\\:4.1271$. The good news is that for the average diameter $\\pm$ standard deviation, we got a smaller diameter than the one we got from the original graph.<br> \n",
    "The closest case is when we get a smaller graph through the subgraph function to transform the multi-graph (the one obtained in the Configuration Model), to a simple one. However, I think it is not enough evidence to conclude and we should try to get a graph with a larger N. \n",

    "We could see that the configuration model behaves identically to the actual network for the degree distribution, the average and its standard deviation. Obviously, this is because it uses the same degree sequence of G (original network) and hence, reproduces its variability. \n",
    "However, for the measures $C_{net}$, $\\langle d \\rangle$ and $d_{diam}$, it behaves like a PRG -or similarly. As long as it is a sort of generalization of the PRG, we should expect the it behaves in a similar manner for those measures, which are the ones that best characterize the dynamics in a RG.  \n",
